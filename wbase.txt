This is a full walkthrough for Nick Neat-Trick-Treat. It details all bonus points.

You need to finish your vegetables. Note the dual rhymes all about.

Also, X ME or I shows you a hint item which tells you the lengths of each word.

> ICK EAT (1)

Then whom do you choose to call?

> PICK PETE (1)

"Meet Me -- Pete P."

> TREAT TREE (1)

Oh no! The treat tree has been trolled! It's a trolled tree!

And now it's dark here in Strick Street! Perhaps you should train first, in the honer house.

> IN

Take out someone who's being a bit of a jerk.

> LONER LOUSE (1)

Now an animal trying to seem bigger than they are.

> MOANER MOUSE (1)

There's also a way to get a bonus point. You can beg for candy anywhere!

==t1
> DONOR DOUSE (1)

> OUT

You can go in any direction except east first. We'll have to cover them all. Let's try north. It's simplest, I hope.

> N

The rank ring is full of rotten boards and stuff. They make different weird noises. Maybe the right one hides something.

> PLANK PLING (1)

So much loot! You don't want to be too greedy.

> BLANK BLING (1)

Be properly grateful.

> THANK THING (1)

The thing seems depressed. There's a bonus point in here.

Okay, let's go south to the tree. It's scary.

> BE BOLD (1)

Hm, you feel a bit unlucky.

> REROLLED (1)

The ground is clay-ey.

> ME MOLD (1)

Clinch the deal.

> SEE SOLD (1)

You can remind the tree of a far-away place for a bonus point.

==t1
> WEE WOLD (1)

You're done here. The only way left from Strick Street is west.

> N

> W

Make things softer.

> FUN FOAM (1)

Now something heavy can land on it.

> TON TOME (1)

Make the reading less heavy.

> PUN POEM (1)

Finish things.

> DONE DOME (1)

Oh no! Too comfy! How to flee?

> RUN ROAM (1)

Also, there is a way to let someone else watch over the new place.

==t1
> A GNOME (1)

> E

Now you have 3 things to manipulate so they go in the plate.

Curled key:

> PLURALED PLEA (1)

Love Look 'Bove Book:

> SHOVE SHOOK (1)

Jet jewel:

> GET GHOUL (1)

> E

How to say things are right?

> DANDY DING (1)

Name a classmate. Several first/last names are acceptable here. Randy tells you all of them

> ANDY NG (1)

On to the fight! Okay, the twins

> CREAKY CRAY (1)

You can also duff them up another way.

==t1
> WEAKIE WAY (1)

But you also have to address that they are twit twins.

==t1
> GRIT GRINS (1)

Okay, they make way for the big boss, Reeky Ray.

Make the weapon misfire.

> STREAKY STRAY (1)

Now, do something only you can.

> SLICK SLEET (1)

The denouement. You found a ton of candy. Don't hog it.

> FAIR FINE (1)

There's one other way to spread the happiness around.

==t1
> SHARE SHINE (1)

You'd love to eat all the candy, but think of a way home first. A new friend can help.

> GREEN GRID (1)

Okay. Time to chow down.

> DARE DINE (1)
