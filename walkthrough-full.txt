This is a full walkthrough for Nick Neat-Trick-Treat. It details all bonus points.

You need to finish your vegetables. Note the dual rhymes all about.

Also, X ME or I shows you a hint item which tells you the lengths of each word.

Then whom do you choose to call?

> PICK PETE (2)

"Meet Me -- Pete P."

And now it's dark here in Strick Steet! Perhaps you should train first, in the honer house.

> MOANER MOUSE (4)

> LONER LOUSE (5)

There's also a way to get a bonus point. You can beg for candy anywhere!

> DONOR DOUSE (6)

> OUT

You can go in any direction except east first. We'll have to cover them all. Let's try north. It's simplest, I hope.

The rank ring is full of rotten boards and stuff. They make different weird noises. Maybe the right one hides something.

Be properly grateful.

> THANK THING (9)

Finish things.

How to say things are right?

You can also duff them up another way.

Make the weapon misfire.

There's one other way to spread the happiness around.
