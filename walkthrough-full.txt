This is a full walkthrough for Nick Neat-Trick-Treat. It details all bonus points.

You need to finish your vegetables. Note the dual rhymes all about.

Also, X ME or I shows you a hint item which tells you the lengths of each word.

> ICK EAT (1)

Then whom do you choose to call?

> PICK PETE (2)

"Meet Me -- Pete P."

> TREAT TREE (3)

Oh no! The treat tree has been trolled! It's a trolled tree!

And now it's dark here in Strick Street! Perhaps you should train first, in the honer house.

> IN

Take out someone who's being a bit of a jerk.

> LONER LOUSE (4)

Now an animal trying to seem bigger than they are.

> MOANER MOUSE (5)

There's also a way to get a bonus point. You can beg for candy anywhere!

> DONOR DOUSE (6)

> OUT

You can go in any direction except east first. We'll have to cover them all. Let's try north. It's simplest, I hope.

> N

The rank ring is full of rotten boards and stuff. They make different weird noises. Maybe the right one hides something.

> PLANK PLING (7)

So much loot! You don't want to be too greedy.

> BLANK BLING (8)

Be properly grateful.

> THANK THING (9)

The thing seems depressed. There's a bonus point in here.

How to let the thing uplift itself?

> SANK SING (10)

> S

Okay, let's go south to the tree. It's scary.

> BE BOLD (11)

Hm, you feel a bit unlucky.

> REROLLED (12)

The ground is clay-ey.

> ME MOLD (13)

Clinch the deal.

> SEE SOLD (14)

You can remind the tree of a far-away place for a bonus point.

> WEE WOLD (15)

You're done here. The only way left from Strick Street is west.

> N

> W

Make things softer.

> FUN FOAM (16)

Now something heavy can land on it.

> TON TOME (17)

Make the reading less heavy.

> PUN POEM (18)

Finish things.

> DONE DOME (19)

Oh no! Too comfy! How to flee?

> RUN ROAM (20)

Also, there is a way to let someone else watch over the new place.

> A GNOME (21)

> E

Now you have 3 things to manipulate so they go in the plate.

Curled key:

> PLURALED PLEA (22)

Love Look 'Bove Book:

> SHOVE SHOOK (23)

Jet jewel:

> GET GHOUL (24)

> E

How to say things are right?

> DANDY DING (25)

Name a classmate. Several first/last names are acceptable here. Randy tells you all of them

> ANDY NG (26)

On to the fight! Okay, the twins. Here you have two equally good ways to riff on their name. I include the one first in the alphabet.

> CREAKY CRAY (27)

You can also duff their egos up another way.

> WEAKIE WAY (28)

But you also have to address that they are twit twins.

> GRIT GRINS (29)

Okay, they make way for the big boss, Reeky Ray.

Make the weapon misfire.

> STREAKY STRAY (30)

Now, do something only you can.

> SLICK SLEET (31)

The denouement. You found a ton of candy. Don't hog it.

> FAIR FINE (32)

There's one other way to spread the happiness around.

> SHARE SHINE (33)

Oh, and you can cosplay a little with the kids in medieval costumes.

> THERE THINE (34)

You'd love to eat all the candy, but think of a way home first. A new friend can help.

> GREEN GRID (35)

Okay. Time to chow down.

> DARE DINE (36)
