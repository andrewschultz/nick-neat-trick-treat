>about
Nick Neat-Trick-Treat was written for EctoComp 2024. It is entry 9 in my Prime Pro-Rhyme Row series and likely the last. The others are Very Vile Fairy File, Quite Queer Night Near, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming, There Those Dare Doze, Bright Brave Knight Knave, Taller Tech Mauler Mech and Beef Beans Grief Greens.
You may have guessed by the use of proper names in puzzles that the concept is reaching its end. But I hadn't done a classic trick-or-treating game, so here it is.
There will be a post-comp version.

Thanks to all administrators past and present of EctoComp: Ruber Eaglenest, Duncan Bowsman, JJ Guest and others I've forgotten.
Thanks to Wade Clarke for testing without being given a lot of time. I owe him one for this.
Thanks to Olaf Nowacki for finding a bug quickly during the comp itself.

There are seven total bonus points. One involves finding both ways to pick at Che and Clay. Here is how to get them all.
Note that some of the bonus points require creative punctuation or emphasis to think of, which is why they are bonus points. But I liked them too much to leave out.
You could have said DONOR DOUSE in the Honer House.
You could have said SANK SING to cheer up the thing in the Rank Ring.
You could have left A GNOME to take care of the Hun Home.
You could have reminded the tree, trolled of the WEE WOLD.
You could have mocked Che and Clay as WEAKIE WAY.
You could've used medieval dialect and offered candy with THERE / THEY'RE THINE.
You could have spread credit around with SHARE SHINE.
