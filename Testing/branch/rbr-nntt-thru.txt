}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Beef, Beans, Grief, Greens has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUSFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.
}$GONG1=A guide gong rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through
}$GONG=That guide gong, again, rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through

>about
Nick Neat-Trick-Treat was written for EctoComp 2024. It is entry 9 in my Prime Pro-Rhyme Row series and likely the last. The others are Very Vile Fairy File, Quite Queer Night Near, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming, There Those Dare Doze, Bright Brave Knight Knave, Taller Tech Mauler Mech and Beef Beans Grief Greens.
You may have guessed by the use of proper names in puzzles that the concept is reaching its end. But I hadn't done a classic trick-or-treating game, so here it is.
There will be a post-comp version.

Thanks to all administrators past and present of EctoComp: Ruber Eaglenest, Duncan Bowsman, JJ Guest and others I've forgotten.
Thanks to Wade Clarke for testing without being given a lot of time. I owe him one for this.
Thanks to Olaf Nowacki for finding a bug quickly during the comp itself.

>gt seat
Since no mutually available rooms are more than two away from each other, the map for Nick Neat-Trick-Treat is small enough. So GT / GO TO is, unlike in other Prime Pro-Rhyme Row games, disabled.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command or see the points or alternate paths you MISSED?
