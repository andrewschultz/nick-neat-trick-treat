#--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Beef, Beans, Grief, Greens has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUSFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.

}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.

}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.
}$GONG1=A guide gong rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through
}$GONG=That guide gong, again, rings to notify you that you don't need to go back through
