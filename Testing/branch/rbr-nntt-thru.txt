>about
Nick Neat-Trick-Treat was written for EctoComp 2024. It is entry 9 in my Prime Pro-Rhyme Row series and likely the last. The others are Very Vile Fairy File, Quite Queer Night Near, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming, There Those Dare Doze, Bright Brave Knight Knave, Taller Tech Mauler Mech and Beef Beans Grief Greens.
You may have guessed by the use of proper names in puzzles that the concept is reaching its end. But I hadn't done a classic trick-or-treating game, so here it is.
There will be a post-comp version.
\\
>credits
Thanks to all administrators past and present of EctoComp: Ruber Eaglenest, Duncan Bowsman, JJ Guest and others I've forgotten.
Thanks to Wade Clarke for testing without being given a lot of time. I owe him one for this.
Thanks to Olaf Nowacki for finding a bug quickly during the comp itself.
