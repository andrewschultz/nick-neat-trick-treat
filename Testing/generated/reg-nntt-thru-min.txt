Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command or see the points or alternate paths you MISSED?

There are seven total bonus points. One involves finding both ways to pick at Che and Clay. Here is how to get them all.
Note that some of the bonus points require creative punctuation or emphasis to think of, which is why they are bonus points. But I liked them too much to leave out.
You could have said DONOR DOUSE in the Honer House.
You could have said SANK SING to cheer up the thing in the Rank Ring.
You could have left A GNOME to take care of the Hun Home.
You could have reminded the tree, trolled of the WEE WOLD.
You could have mocked Che and Clay as WEAKIE WAY.
You could've used medieval dialect and offered candy with THERE / THEY'RE THINE.
You could have spread credit around with SHARE SHINE.
