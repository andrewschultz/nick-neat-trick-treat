#testcase-check-vc-ick-eat-rule-fallthrough
You mouth the phrase to yourself. You think it. It wouldn't do to say it aloud. You worry you're getting a bit too old for either saying the phrase or disliking vegetables. But a part of you hopes you always hate certain vegetables. You have to stand for SOMETHING, after all.
But the vegetables aren't bad once you start in on them. They just don't compare to trick or treat candy.
You have a lot of friends to go out with. But who's the best fit for tonight? Well, you've sort of already chosen. Just got to remember whom to, uh, choose.

You message Pete on your phone. Pete P. He has a long name nobody can quite pronounce. Well, some kids do, and they get called show-offs. He's not ashamed of his long name. He just understands. You know how to spell it and pronounce it.
The message back: "Meet me. -- Pete P."
But where?

#testcase-check-vc-treat-tree-rule-fallthrough
Meeting by the treat tree should be easy, but the area is much darker than you remember. The tree even starts talking ... someone or something has cast a spell on it, so it can't enjoy Halloween, or it can't help others to. It's a trolled tree now. It nudges you north to a neighborhood you didn't know existed.
And you're pretty sure Strick Street isn't an avenue, as strick isn't really a word, but sadly it fits in here.
How to make things un-struck?

#testcase-check-vc-donor-douse-rule-fallthrough
You cheekily ask for more candy, even though there doesn't appear to be anyone here. A voice promises you it will be waiting at game's end.
Your score and bonus points just went up by one point.
A stun-steed zooms by, bellowing "None-need-done deed!" Have you lost focus on what's really important? Or just put in a bit of extra rigor? You decide on the second, as you could also imagine a bin-bare-min mare to insult you for finding no extra neat stuff.

Yes! That's more like it. It maybe wasn't that brave to look for ways to be more brave, but you did so, and you found them. The tree, trolled, almost seems to smile. "I need a piece of you, or an effigy of you, or something. Then I will give you something back."
Weird, but maybe you're in luck. The ground is soft here ... maybe you can make something of it.

#testcase-check-vc-me-mold-rule-fallthrough
Ah, there we go! It looks ... vaguely like you, you guess. Sadly, Mart Made-Art-Aid, that cool summer camp counselor (as you called him,) isn't here to give pointers.
It was work, though, and you're not giving it away for free. The tree, trolled, indicates it wants to engage in commerce, of a sort.

#testcase-check-vc-see-sold-rule-fallthrough
The tree is impressed by your confidence. It swaps: the key, cold, for the me-mold. Perhaps you have a future career as an artist! Or just a side hustle.
But the key quickly warms up when you grab it! And my, what an odd shape it is, too. Whirled, curled. A whirled (whee) curled key!
There doesn't seem to be anything else to say. Though the tree does seem to want to chat. Perhaps about distant lands. But where? It's still feeling trolled, so it won't want to start the conversation.

#testcase-check-vc-see-sold-rule-if-sco-see-sold-is-true

#testcase-check-vc-wee-wold-rule-fallthrough
At your suggestion, the tree, trolled launches into stories of the far-off Wee Wold. After a while, it apologizes for taking so long. But really, you don't mind. You're glad you took the time, even if it doesn't further your quest.

But thinking a bit more, you feel sort of bad. You always felt the Asian kids were all just sort of there and similar, but maybe they thought the same way about you and Pete P. You think of how they are different, despite similar names ... Sandy, Andy, Landy, Mandy. Perhaps they find your last names as odd as you find theirs.

Perhaps the shared experience of the final fight will help. Between you and Pete and your classmates and Randy.

Each bite reminds you of friends and adventures, and even the bad candy tastes good. Your parents are shocked it lasts through Christmas. They are proud of your restraint -- you are growing up! Of course, if you explained the whole adventure, they would talk about kids and THEIR IMAGINATION.
