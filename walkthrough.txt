This is a quick walkthrough for Nick Neat-Trick-Treat. It neglects bonus points.

You need to finish your vegetables. Note the dual rhymes all about.

Also, X ME or I shows you a hint item which tells you the lengths of each word.

> ICK EAT (1)

Then whom do you choose to call?

> PICK PETE (2)

"Meet Me -- Pete P."

> TREAT TREE (3)

Oh no! The treat tree has been trolled! It's a trolled tree!

And now it's dark here in Strick Street! Perhaps you should train first, in the honer house.

> IN

Take out someone who's being a bit of a jerk.

> LONER LOUSE (4)

Now an animal trying to seem bigger than they are.

> MOANER MOUSE (5)

There's also a way to get a bonus point. You can beg for candy anywhere!

> OUT

You can go in any direction except east first. We'll have to cover them all. Let's try north. It's simplest, I hope.

> N

The rank ring is full of rotten boards and stuff. They make different weird noises. Maybe the right one hides something.

> PLANK PLING (6)

So much loot! You don't want to be too greedy.

> BLANK BLING (7)

Be properly grateful.

> THANK THING (8)

The thing seems depressed. There's a bonus point in here.

> SANK SING (9)

> S

Okay, let's go south to the tree. It's scary.

> BE BOLD (10)

Hm, you feel a bit unlucky.

> REROLLED (11)

The ground is clay-ey.

> ME MOLD (12)

Clinch the deal.

> SEE SOLD (13)

You can remind the tree of a far-away place for a bonus point.

You're done here. The only way left from Strick Street is west.

> N

> W

Make things softer.

> FUN FOAM (14)

Now something heavy can land on it.

> TON TOME (15)

Make the reading less heavy.

> PUN POEM (16)

Finish things.

> DONE DOME (17)

Oh no! Too comfy! How to flee?

> RUN ROAM (18)

Also, there is a way to let someone else watch over the new place.

> E

Now you have 3 things to manipulate so they go in the plate.

Curled key:

> PLURALED PLEA (19)

Love Look 'Bove Book:

> SHOVE SHOOK (20)

Jet jewel:

> GET GHOUL (21)

> E

How to say things are right?

> DANDY DING (22)

Name a classmate. Several first/last names are acceptable here. Randy tells you all of them

> ANDY NG (23)

On to the fight! Okay, the twins

> CREAKY CRAY (24)

You can also duff them up another way.

But you also have to address that they are twit twins.

Okay, they make way for the big boss, Reeky Ray.

Make the weapon misfire.

> STREAKY STRAY (25)

Now, do something only you can.

> SLICK SLEET (26)

The denouement. You found a ton of candy. Don't hog it.

> FAIR FINE (27)

There's one other way to spread the happiness around.

You'd love to eat all the candy, but think of a way home first. A new friend can help.

> GREEN GRID (28)

Okay. Time to chow down.

> DARE DINE (29)
